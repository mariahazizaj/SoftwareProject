Our group decided to develop a store management system project.
Objective
The Store Management System is a simple web-based application platform for stores 
that can help them to manage their products.
 
This Store Management System in PHP and MySQL Database is only accessible to the Store Management.
The system requires user credentials in order for the management to access the data, features, and functionalities. 
It has 2 types of user roles which are the Administrators and Employee.

About the task distribution each memeber will work on coding. Then we will devide the tasks as below:

Project Manager: Oversees the project, sets deadlines, assigns tasks, and communicates with team members to ensure that the project is progressing smoothly.

UI/UX Designer: UI UX designers create the user interface for an app, website, or other interactive media. Their work includes collaborating with product managers and engineers to gather requirements from users before designing ideas that can be communicated using storyboards. They also process flows or sitemaps.

Frontend Developer: Builds the client-side of the app using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, working closely with the UI/UX designer to ensure that the app meets the design specifications.

Database Administrator: Designs, develops, and maintains the database that the app uses to store data and manages access to the data.

Quality Assurance (QA) Specialist: Tests the app to ensure that it is functioning correctly and meets the project's requirements, identifying and reporting bugs and issues to the rest of the team.

Even though the tasks are separated as above we will still work with each other as a team for each of them, consulate with each other and solve each problem together.
